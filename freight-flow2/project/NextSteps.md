fix ui as the components are nested withing one another
fleet, messaging and invoices just mirror the dashboard that needs to change and get their own pages 
invoice page is a invoice creator. users can upload thieir logo to thier user profile and user that on the business invoice. have regular template that has autoupdate features like pay date 30 days after etc. -use modeles like pdfkit etc 
messages component is a ui chatbot with a llm chat response
documents page needs a pdf parser to work and then pull the data that isnt static for the border connect api like driver and truck info. borderconnect api functions already done in service border connect 
having an issue with displaying updated loads from inside the data base - load posts to the data base which is great but loads component doesnt recognize that. 
most buttons still not clickable. settings buttons dont work. cannot updated settings info and save it. needs to also reflect in the suprabase database
